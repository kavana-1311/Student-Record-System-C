# Student-Record-System-C
# Student Record Management System (TCP Version)

This project is a simple **Student Record Management System** that can:

* Read student data from a CSV file.
* Perform basic operations like **list**, **search**, and **sort**.
* Send all student data from a **Sender program** to a **Receiver program** using **TCP socket communication**.
* Save the received data into a new CSV file.
* Measure basic performance statistics.

---

## 📌 Features

### **1. Core Student Operations**

* List all students
* Search student by ID
* Sort students by name

### **2. TCP Communication**

* Sender connects to Receiver using TCP.
* Sender transmits full student data.
* Receiver stores the data into `received.csv`.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Project

### ✔️ **1. Start the Receiver (Terminal 1)**

```
./receiver
```

You should see:

```
Server started... waiting for connection...
```

### ✔️ **2. Run the Sender (Terminal 2)**

```
./sender
```

Select:

```
5. Send Data to Receiver
```

You will see:

```
Connected to server
Data sent successfully
```

Receiver terminal will show:

```
Client connected!
Data received and saved to received.csv
```

---

## 📁 Input File

The sender reads student data from:

```
students.csv
```

Example format:

```
1,John,19,A
2,Asha,20,B
```

---

## 📊 Performance Metrics

Measured in the program:

* Number of records processed
* Time taken to load and parse CSV
* Time taken to sort records
* Time taken to transmit data over TCP
* Time taken to save received CSV file
* Memory usage (optional)

These results are printed in the terminal after execution.

---

## 📦 Tools Used

* **C Language**
* **TCP Sockets** (sender & receiver)
* **WSL / Linux environment**
* **Git & GitHub** for version control

---

## 📘 Summary

This project demonstrates:

* File handling in C
* Structs and arrays
* Sorting and searching
* Network programming basics
* Measuring simple performance metrics

It is a clean and simple implementation suitable for learning and academic submissions.

🔁 Difference from Original Problem Statement

The original requirement mentioned sending data using WebSockets.
In this project, I used TCP sockets instead of WebSockets because:

TCP is simpler to implement in C

TCP still satisfies the requirement of sending data between two programs

The focus of the project (CSV handling, sorting, searching, performance measurement) remains fully covered

TCP provides reliable data transmission, similar to WebSockets

The remaining functionalities — data loading, menu operations, sending/receiving CSV, and performance statistics — were implemented completely.
